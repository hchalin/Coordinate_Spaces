ðŸš€ 3D Transformations in Metal
This project explores fundamental 3D transformations â€” translation, rotation, and scaling â€” using Appleâ€™s Metal API. Built with Swift and MetalKit, it provides a minimal yet extensible framework for applying and visualizing transformation matrices in a GPU-accelerated rendering pipeline.
